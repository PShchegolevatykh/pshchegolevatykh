                    <h4>Thoughts on playing Brood War since Remastered</h4>
                    <p>A year ago when Starcraft: Remastered was announced I decided to give this game a proper try and become at least average at it. The game had its 20 years anniversary in 2018, and there were plently of players who started playing since the very beggining. I expected to be smashed in almost every game at the beggining, but then steadily to get better and better at it.</p>
                    <p>Why out of all the modern games available I picked a 20 year-old game with tough mechanics? I think there were many factors to that.</p>
                    <h5>Reasons</h5>
                    <p>The main reason I believe was nostalgia. I never played BW properly back then. I remember its early days when I was in highschool. Our young computer science teacher loved this game. He took it seriously. He was even watching Korean VODs on our school projector at his free time, trying to show us all how cool the game was. Also we had kind of LAN parties after school he was beating me and my classmates pretty badly. We played in aliance of 3-4 people vs just him alone and could not a single match. At that time I was too young to understand or care about this game at all. Now I see those school days as a lost oppurtunity. I could have learned a lot having a proper teacher and lots of classmates to practice and discuss the builds.</p>
                    <p>Instead I picked another shiny new RTS game - Warcraft III: Frozen Throne. It was modern and easier to play. Also I always liked fantasy more. Even though I was playing WC3 I always had respect for Starcraft players in Internet Cafes and Online. I even watched some of WCG BW VODs and was pretty impressed by what I saw there. Later on I found out that a guy from my neighborhood (his name was Anton) played BroodWar competitively on Podolsk Russian Server. I was very impressed by that. He showed me his replays, and how he managed to beat <span class="player-name"><img src="images/p.gif"> <strong>Bruce</strong></span> on one of their practice games. From him I also learned about <span class="player-name"><img src="images/t.gif"> <strong>NaDa</strong></span> and the Korean pro scene.</p>
                    <p>Overall BroodWar to me was a well respected game that was always out there. The thing that was bothering me back then was the abscence of matchmaking, I could not imagine asking random people to practice with me every time I wanted to play. Also there were almost no rewards for your wins, nothing like shiny portraits or character level like WC3 had.</p>
                    <p>The other reason was its complex mechanics. You can achieve a lot with little. Even small things like sending your workers to mine were exceptionally hard comparing to other games. WC3 had decent mechanics but nowhere near as hard, and Starcraft 2 mechanics were much worse. SC2 units felt too small and fluid so I never truely cared about them enough to micro. I never felt any attachment and warm feelings to SC2 units. Felts also like the game engine slows you down, and you don't have a fine control over every pixel on the screen.</p>
                    <p>In Remastered Blizzard introduced matchmaking and that would allow me to find games without talking to strangers. As for the new graphics I did not really care. I loved the old graphics back then and still love to this day. Glad they did not go too far with the renovations. Though I still hate new probes, DTs and zerglings compared to the original.</p>
                    <h5>First games</h5>
                    <p>I started with a single player campaign even before the official Remastered release. So by the time the game is out I already would be somewhat comfortable with the it. Also played a custom game on battle.net hosting something like "1v1 complete noobs plz" and got rushed in ZvZ losing my first 4 sets of lings killing nothing. Since then I went back to the single player and focused only on it.</p>
                    <p>After Remastered came out I rebinded all of the hotkeys to use Grid layout (QWE-ASD-ZXC). That way I believed it would be easier to play and learn the hotkeys since they are all placed together. Then there was constant laddering. Before starting I watched zerg FPVoDs by <span class="player-name"><img src="images/z.gif"> <strong>L_Master</strong></span> and made notes for each matchup in a dedicated to Starcraft notebook (ZvP, ZvZ, ZvT). It was pretty useful to start with. Also watched some ladder streams of <span class="player-name"><img src="images/z.gif"> <strong>PiG</strong></span>. Sadly, he stopped playing SC:R shortly after the release. In terms of MMR I was way lower than I expected. Every new account started with 1500 MMR. I was constantly dropping below 1500 and then returning back to 1500 but never went further than that. It felt discouraged, like every new account had better score than I had. Then there came location matching patch for matchmaker and I never get above 1200 MMR playing against the same players.</p>
                    <p>Here's one particular game I remember from those days. I got a terran played who looked way better than me. I did not know the map and could not even scout his main base until the very end. His pressured constantly with drops and bio pushes, I was in a crisis management mode during the whole game.</p>
                    <div class="center">
                        <img src="images/quad-vs-agneum.jpg">
                    </div>
                    <p>At some point I already accepted defeat and focused purely on mechanics and keeping my money low during the rest of the game. He did a lot of cute micro intensive things with small groups but got a huge mineral bank and in the end I came back and punished him with the superior lurker army.</p>
                    <p><span class="player-name"><img src="images/z.gif"> <strong>BRu.QuaD</strong></span> vs <span class="player-name"><img src="images/t.gif"> <strong>Agneum</strong></span> (<a href="replays/quad_Z_vs_agneum_T.rep" download="quad_Z_vs_agneum_T.rep">replay</a>)</p>
                    <p>This illustrates the point of my <a href="../../../../2017/06/04/starcraft2-basics/">previous post about Starcraft II</a>. This is a game about money, you can be a micro God but if I have way more supply I'll punish you. That was the first hard thing I learned by example.</p>
                    <p>My next major victory was against a player I lost two times in a row before. I thought he was way better than me and I would never win. So I convinced myself to put everything I learned so far into this game and show him that I was a worthy opponent. He played many years in BroodWar before taking a break, while I played only for two months at that point.</p>
                    <div class="center">
                        <img src="images/quad-vs-canabeast.jpg">
                    </div>
                    <p>Surprisingly our last game went into a long macro game, and I knew zergs feel better in the late game. He did a pretty good drop on my main in the mid game, but I managed to survive having more bases and more resources. So when I maxed out I just sent my units for the final blow.</p>
                    <p><span class="player-name"><img src="images/z.gif"> <strong>BRu.QuaD</strong></span> vs <span class="player-name"><img src="images/t.gif"> <strong>CanaBeasT</strong></span> (<a href="replays/quad_Z_vs_CanaBeast_T.rep" download="quad_Z_vs_CanaBeast_T.rep">replay</a>)</p>
                    <p>In general I was very bad at microing units. In all my games I was throwing away small chunks of them to be killed. I did not use any contol groups so click-selecting was very hard, especially in the late game. Anyway, my second important lesson was that I could beat stronger players if get fully focused on the game and put my best self into it. If only I could play like it was a matter of life and death I'll be in good shape.</p>
                    <h5>Playing to Win</h5>
                    <p>Struggling to improve my play I stumbled upon <a href="https://liquipedia.net/starcraft/Day(9)_Podcasts">Day9 podcasts liquipedia page</a>. This was the best thing I did at that time. Combined with his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgmCLtUkEutKY8IlwyVCUFoRtgQe3LCf1">Let's Learn Starcraft</a> youtube series they gave me <strong>LOTS</strong> of insight of how the game worked, what should I focus on, psychology of the game, different stages of each matchup, etc. I could not even ephasise how useful they were. If you don't have time to read any further or watch anything else do just this single thing: listen to all of Day9 podcasts and watch all of his Let's Learn Starcraft episodes. I was very inspired! I even bought a paperback of <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18171.Playing_to_Win">David Sirlin's Playing to Win</a> which was very useful as well. From this book I learned that there are no cheesy strats, every strategy you do is just as good as any other strategy as long as you win the game. Also the book teaches you the proper attitude towards the game bugs and balance issues. You'll become more mature as a player after reading it.</p>
                    <p>Though don't expect your MMR go up after all this. It won't, and that's okay. As H.G. Wells well said:</p>
                    <blockquote><p>There are truths you have to grow into.</p></blockquote>
                    <p>I'd recommend constantly going back to those lessons and podcasts at different stages of your life as Starcraft player. You will be amazed how much value you missed the last time. More and more things will start to make sense.</p>
                    <p>Though at first it's better to learn just enough to see the big picture and start practicing playing on ladder. I picked just one solid macro build for each matchup (ZvZ, ZvT, ZvP) and used it in every game. This won't take you far, but at least you'll start feeling comfortable with the game after hundreds of games without being stressed out too much. I learned many weaknesses of those builds the hard way. Only much later did I realize they were not actually "build weaknesses".</p>
                    <h5>The Red Clan</h5>
                    <p>Hearing constantly how much being a part of the community mattered I decided to look for a clan to practice with somebody. I put myself out in a clan recruitment thread on TeamLiquid and almost immidiately Red Clan orga <span class="player-name"><img src="images/p.gif"> <strong>Nadine</strong></span> dropped me a message in Discord. I was pleasantly surprised at how well things went there. The people were very kind and understanding, I had a chance to play on internal clean leagues and sometimes on actual clan wars. I was in a third squad that was assembled for "The Little League". It was a BWCL league just for noobs (players below 1500MMR).</p>
                    <p>Even though I was the weakest player of all I still felt pretty comfortable. I kept losing on any clanwar I played. I never won any set during the whole time. It was very hard. Even on those noob leagues there were plenty of good players abusing the rules to get there. Not even once I faced any player who was not stronger than me MMR-wise. The single game I won in the series was in ZvZ outsmarting my opponent. I was going for two-base speedling all-in. Normally this build goes without any Lair upgrade, but since I mined the extra 100 gas by mistake of not pulling out drones in time seeing his overlord I went for the Lair anyway.</p>
                    <div class="center">
                        <img src="images/quad-vs-jojo.jpg">
                    </div>
                    <p>I never returned drones back to gas, never leveraged the Lair tech. Just by showing the Lair I sent the wrong message to my opponent and went for full ling all-in instead. He was microing very good during the game but my ling numbers grew at a much higher rate that his. So he was not ready with his defences in time and lost the game. Our overall score was 1:2 and all the other games were very one-sided.</p>
                    <p><span class="player-name"><img src="images/z.gif"> <strong>Red.QuaD</strong></span> vs <span class="player-name"><img src="images/z.gif"> <strong>ash.jOjO</strong></span> (<a href="replays/quad_Z_vs_jOjO_Z.rep" download="quad_Z_vs_jOjO_Z.rep">replay</a>)</p>
                    <p>After this memorable game there was not anything even close during the rest of the year. I was stagnating as a player, and after a certain starting point it was exponentially harder to improve putting the same amount of hours to BroodWar each day.</p>
                    <h5>Having Fun with the original BroodWar</h5>
                    <p>Watching the old VODs I had an idea to try the original BroodWar someday. Since the <a href="https://iccup.com/starcraft/">ICCUP server</a> was still alive (though very small amount of players left there, less than 100 people online in the evening) it was technically possible.</p>
                    <p>To have a full retro expirience I bought an original BroodWar DVD box on eBay. Also got nerdy and found native 640x480 LCD display. Turned out that an old SD-TV was a perfect fit. I got <a href="https://www.philips.ru/c-p/20PFL4112S_60/51-cm-20-inch-lcd">Philips 20PFL4112S</a> on Avito (Russian Craigslist-like thing) and combined it with my old Windows XP laptop. This TV even had a DVI input which was super cool for the picture quality. It was also capable of 75Hz refresh rate instead of default 65Hz. The image was very crisp. I installed BroodWar from two CDs, then patched it to 1.16.1 and got an ICCUP client. Everything ran smoothly.</p>
                    <p>PICTURE HERE</p>
                    <p>I also had no problems connecting my 400 DPI Logitech Mini Optical mouse to this laptop. I did not even have to change any mouse settings. I got a perfect setup.</p>
                    <p>Though having perfect setup did not mean my games were going to be perfect. The remaining players there were super strong. Also despite all Blizzard promises the gameplay felt a bit off. It was noticable switching from Remastered graphics to 1.16.1 and required some time to get used to. Despite many attempts I had only one close-enough game there against a D+ ranked <a href="https://iccup.com/starcraft/gamingprofile/o_p_g.html">player</a> <span class="player-name"><img src="images/p.gif"> <strong>o_p_g</strong></span>.</p>
