                    <h4>[DRAFT]What did it feel like to start playing Brood War since Remastered</h4>
                    <p>This is mainly for those of you who never played the original Starcraft: Brood War before and still in doubt if it's too late to start learning the game. The game had its 20 years anniversary in 2018, and there were plently of players who started playing since the very beggining.</p>
                    <p>A year ago when Starcraft: Remastered was announced I decided to give this game a proper try and become at least average at it. I knew there were lots of expirienced players already. I knew I would be smashed in every game.</p>
                    <p>Why out of all the modern games available I picked a 20 year-old game with tough mechanics? I think there were many factors to that.</p>
                    <p>First of all of course nostalgia. I've never played BW properly but I remember the early days when our computer science school teacher was beating me and my friends pretty badly at the game. We played in aliance of 4-5 people vs just him and could not win no matter what. He was pretty good, he also tried to show us some Korean VODs on the school projector, but I was too young to understand, too young too care about this game at all. Now I see this as a lost oppurtunity. I could have learned lost of useful things and could have had tons of fun competing against other players.</p>
                    <p>Weirdly enough I picked Warcraft III: Frozen Throne as my main game to practice. It was more modern and easier to play. During the times of playing WC3 I always had respect for Starcraft players in Internet Cafes and Online. Even watched some WCG VODs and was pretty impressed by what I saw there. So BW to me was the game that was always out there, but I never had a chance to play it properly. The thing that was bothering me back then was the abscence of matchmaking, I could not imagine asking random strangers to play with me the whole day.</p>
                    <p>Secondly this game had the best mechanics ever! WC3 had decent mechanics but not perfect, and Starcraft 2 mechanics were way worse in my opinion. SC2 units felt too small and fluid so I never truely cared about them enough to practice good micro.</p>
                    <p>So the killer feature of Remastered for me was introducing matchmaking that would allow me to find games without asking strangers. I loved the old graphics and love to this day, so I did not care about that aspect at all. This was the time to give the game a proper respect it always deserved.</p>
