                    <h4>Thoughts on playing Brood War since Remastered</h4>
                    <p>A year ago when Starcraft: Remastered was announced I decided to give this game a proper try and become at least average at it. The game had its 20 years anniversary in 2018, and there were plently of players who started playing since the very beggining. I expected to be smashed in almost every game at the beggining, but then steadily to get better and better at it.</p>
                    <p>Why out of all the modern games available I picked a 20 year-old game with tough mechanics? I think there were many factors to that.</p>
                    <h5>Reasons</h5>
                    <p>The main reason I believe was nostalgia. I never played BW properly back then. I remember its early days when I was in highschool. Our young computer science teacher loved this game. He took it seriously. He was even watching Korean VODs on our school projector at his free time, trying to show us all how cool the game was. Also we had kind of LAN parties after school he was beating me and my classmates pretty badly. We played in aliance of 3-4 people vs just him alone and could not a single match. At that time I was too young to understand or care about this game at all. Now I see those school days as a lost oppurtunity. I could have learned a lot having a proper teacher and lots of classmates to practice and discuss the builds.</p>
                    <p>Instead I picked another shiny new RTS game - Warcraft III: Frozen Throne. It was modern and easier to play. Also I always liked fantasy more. Even though I was playing WC3 I always had respect for Starcraft players in Internet Cafes and Online. I even watched some of WCG BW VODs and was pretty impressed by what I saw there. Later on I found out that a guy from my neighborhood (his name was Anton) played BroodWar competitively on Podolsk Russian Server. I was very impressed by that. He showed me his replays, and how he managed to beat <span class="player-name"><img src="images/p.gif"> <strong>Bruce</strong></span> on one of their practice games. From him I also learned about <span class="player-name"><img src="images/t.gif"> <strong>NaDa</strong></span> and the Korean pro scene.</p>
                    <p>Overall BroodWar to me was a well respected game that was always out there. The thing that was bothering me back then was the abscence of matchmaking, I could not imagine asking random people to practice with me every time I wanted to play. Also there were almost no rewards for your wins, nothing like shiny portraits or character level like WC3 had.</p>
                    <p>The other reason was its complex mechanics. You can achieve a lot with little. Even small things like sending your workers to mine were exceptionally hard comparing to other games. WC3 had decent mechanics but nowhere near as hard, and Starcraft 2 mechanics were much worse. SC2 units felt too small and fluid so I never truely cared about them enough to micro. I never felt any attachment and warm feelings to SC2 units. Felts also like the game engine slows you down, and you don't have a fine control over every pixel on the screen.</p>
                    <p>In Remastered Blizzard introduced matchmaking and that would allow me to find games without talking to strangers. As for the new graphics I did not really care. I loved the old graphics back then and still love to this day. Glad they did not go too far with the renovations. Though I still hate new probes, DTs and zerglings compared to the original.</p>
                    <h5>First games</h5>
                    <p>I started with a single player campaign even before the official Remastered release. So by the time the game is out I already would be somewhat comfortable with the it. Also played a custom game on battle.net hosting something like "1v1 complete noobs plz" and got rushed in ZvZ losing my first 4 sets of lings killing nothing. Since then I went back to the single player and focused only on it.</p>
                    <p>After Remastered came out I rebinded all of the hotkeys to use Grid layout (QWE-ASD-ZXC). That way I believed it would be easier to play and learn the hotkeys since they are all placed together. Then there was constant laddering. Before starting I watched zerg FPVoDs by <span class="player-name"><img src="images/z.gif"> <strong>L_Master</strong></span> and made notes for each matchup in a dedicated to Starcraft notebook (ZvP, ZvZ, ZvT). It was pretty useful to start with. In terms of MMR I was way lower than I expected. Every new account started with 1500 MMR. I was constantly dropping below 1500 and then returning back to 1500 but never went further than that. It felt discouraged, like every new account had better score than I had. Then there came location matching patch for matchmaker and I never get above 1200 MMR playing against the same players.</p>
                    <p>Here's one particular game I remember from those days. I got a terran played who looked way better than me. I did not know the map and could not even scout his main base until the very end. His pressured constantly with drops and bio pushes, I was in a crisis management mode during the whole game. At some point I already accepted defeat and focused purely on mechanics and keeping my money low during the rest of the game. He did a lot of cute micro intensive things with small groups but got a huge mineral bank and in the end I came back and punished him with the superior lurker army.</p>

                    <p>This illustrates the point of my <a href="../../../../2017/06/04/starcraft2-basics/">previous post about Starcraft II</a>. This is a game about money, you can be a micro God but if I have way more supply I'll punish you. That was the first hard thing I learned by example.</p>
